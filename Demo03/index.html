          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello! I am <b>Anish Sauda</b>, a passionate and dedicated Bachelor
            of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a strong foundation in
            computer science and software development. Currently pursuing my
            degree at <b>Institute of Information Technology & Management</b>, I
            have developed a keen interest in areas such as programming, web
            development, database management, and software engineering.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various
            programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.
            My coursework and projects have provided me with hands-on experience
            in developing software applications, designing user-friendly
            websites, and managing databases efficiently. My goal is to leverage
            my knowledge and skills to create innovative solutions that address
            real-world problems and contribute to the ever-evolving field of
            technology. In this portfolio, you will find a showcase of my
            academic projects, personal projects, and any relevant work
            experience or internships. Each project demonstrates my ability to
            apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, highlighting my
            problem-solving abilities, creativity, and attention to detail. I am
            eager to continue learning and growing in the field of computer
            science and look forward to opportunities that challenge me and
            allow me to make a meaningful impact. Thank you for taking the time
            to review my portfolio.
